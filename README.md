How to run:
Compile all files within the src/project02 package folder, then run the MassiveMotion.java file to view the simulation.

Description:
The Massive Motion project is a Java class that simulates small black comets/stars moving across a 2D canvas at random velocities with a larger central red star in the middle, holding these objects in a specified list type: ArrayList, SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, and DummyHeadLinkedList, then using their list iterators to continuously update and repaint each moving star. Furthermore, each list has the basic core operations of a list: adding at position, adding at end, getting at index, removal, and retrieving the number of elements in the list. Finally, the configurations for the window dimensions, star size, and star velocities are determined through a configuration file that is read using Properties. If the file is missing, then default values are passed in instead.
